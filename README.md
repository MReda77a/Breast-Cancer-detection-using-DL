Breast Cancer detection using EfficientNet Deep learning
Breast cancer is one of the most prevalent diseases among women around the world. Due to the importance of early detection and diagnosis during the curing process, the computational power of deep learning has been exploited to obtain as high accuracy as possible with the least resources. In recent years, researchers have utilized state-of-the-art supervised machine learning and deep learning models for the sake of aid the medical staff in breast cancer discovery. We introduce the utilization of the latest adaptive CNN-based model Efficient Net in the classification of benign and malignant breast cancer images. After several attempts, it turned out that, the EfficientNet has the ability to bring
higher accuracy off compared to the InceptionNet and many other deep learning algorithms in this problem with 91.44% which indicates the EfficientNetâ€™s accuracy, efficacy, and flexibility in different domains.
